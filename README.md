## Abstract :

Network intrusions pose a significant threat to organizational networks, resulting in substantial financial losses and reputational damage. This project proposes a full-stack network intrusion detection system using machine learning techniques. The system collects and analyzes network traffic data, extracts relevant features, and trains machine learning models to detect intrusions. The project implements a web-based interface for system administrators to monitor and manage the system. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in detecting network intrusions with high accuracy. The project contributes to the development of robust network intrusion detection systems using machine learning techniques.
